RESPONSIVE GUI DESIGNING FRAMEWORK

What is KIVY?
	Kivy is an open source Python library for developing mobile apps and other multitouch application software with a natural user interface (NUI). It can run on Android, iOS, Linux, OS X, and Windows. Distributed under the terms of the MIT license, Kivy is free and open source software.
Kivy is the main framework developed by the Kivy organization, alongside Python for Android, Kivy IOS, and several other libraries meant to be used on all platforms. In 2012, Kivy got a $5000 grant from the Python Software Foundation for porting it to Python 3.3 Kivy also supports the Raspberry Pi which was funded through Bountysource. 
The framework contains all the elements for building an application such as:
extensive input support for mouse, keyboard, TUIO, and OS-specific multitouch events,
a graphic library using only OpenGL ES 2, and based on Vertex Buffer Object and shaders,
a wide range of widgets that support multitouch,
an intermediate language (Kv) used to easily design custom widgets.
Kivy is the evolution of the PyMT project, and is recommended for new projects 


Used Database system:
MYSQL:-  MySQL is an open source relational database management system (RDBMS). Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language.
MySQL is free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License, and is also available under a variety of proprietary licenses. MySQL was owned and sponsored by the Swedish company MySQL AB, which was bought by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation). In 2010, when Oracle acquired Sun, Widenius forked the open-source MySQL project to create MariaDB.
MySQL is a component of the LAMP web application software stack (and others), which is an acronym for Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python. MySQL is used by many database-driven web applications, including Drupal, Joomla, phpBB, and WordPress. MySQL is also used by many popular websites, including Google (though not for searches), Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and YouTube.
